# Blog and Transltor Web Apps
This webpage consists of a blog app and a translator app. The Home page displays blogs that have been written by users that have been given admin access. 
The user can also select the translator tab which will redirect the user to a page where they enter text in the left side textbox and it will be 
translated into German and displayed in the right side box. There is an admin page as well, where posts can be deleted or edited. 

The main objective was to excercise the use of Django in the creation of a webpage with multiple web apps within it. 
In creating the app I also learned about the architecture of Django and understanding the relationship between models, views, urls, and html.
